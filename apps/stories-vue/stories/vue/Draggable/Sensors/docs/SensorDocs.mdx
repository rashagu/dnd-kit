# Sensors

Detect user input and translate them into drag operations.

## Overview

Sensors are an abstraction to detect different input methods in order to initiate drag operations, respond to movement and end or cancel the operation.

## Built-in sensors

The `@dnd-kit/dom/modifiers` package provides a set of built-in sensors that can be used to detect user input in the browser.

### Pointer sensor

The Pointer sensor responds to [Pointer events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events). This sensor is enabled by default.

> Pointer events are DOM events that are fired for a pointing device. They are designed to create a single DOM event model to handle pointing input devices such as a mouse, pen/stylus or touch (such as one or more fingers).
> The pointer is a hardware-agnostic device that can target a specific set of screen coordinates.

#### Activation constraints

The Pointer sensor has two types of activation constraints:

- Distance constraint
- Delay constraint

These activation constraints are not mutually exclusive, they can be used simultaneously. In case both constraints are used, the Pointer sensor will activate as soon as one of the constraints is met.

```js
import {PointerSensor} from '@dnd-kit/dom/sensors';

const sensors = [
  PointerSensor.configure({
    activationConstraints: {
      distance: {value: 5},
      delay: {value: 200, tolerance: 10},
    },
  }),
];
```

The **distance** `value` property represents the distance, in _pixels_, that a pointer needs to be moved by before a drag operation is initiated.

The **delay** `value` property represents the duration, in _milliseconds_, that a draggable item needs to be held by the primary pointer for before a drag start event is emitted.

The `tolerance` property represents the distance, in pixels, of motion that is tolerated before the drag operation is aborted. If the pointer is moved during the delay duration and the tolerance is set to zero, the drag operation will be immediately aborted. If a higher tolerance is set, for example, a tolerance of 5 pixels, the operation will only be aborted if the pointer is moved by more than 5 pixels during the delay.

This property is particularly useful for touch input, where some tolerance should be accounted for when using a delay constraint, as touch input is less precise than mouse input.

### Keyboard sensor

The Keyboard sensor responds to [Keyboard events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent). This sensor is enabled by default.

The keyboard sensor activates when the `handle` or `element` of a draggable source is focused and the `Space` or `Enter` key is pressed.

#### Configuration

The Keyboard sensor can be configured to respond to different keyboard codes:

```js
import {KeyboardSensor} from '@dnd-kit/dom/sensors';

const sensors = [
  KeyboardSensor.configure({
    keyboardCodes: {
      start: ['Space', 'Enter'],
      cancel: ['Escape'],
      end: ['Space', 'Enter'],
      up: ['ArrowUp'],
      down: ['ArrowDown'],
      left: ['ArrowLeft'],
      right: ['ArrowRight'],
    },
  }),
];
```

You may customize these values, but do keep in mind that the [third rule of ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#3rdrule) requires that a user must be able to activate the action associated with a draggable widget using both the enter (on Windows) or return (on macOS) and the space key. To learn more, read the in-depth accessibility guide.

## Usage

Sensors can be applied globally or to individual draggable elements.

### Global sensors

Sensors can be applied globally by passing them to the `<DragDropProvider>` component.

```jsx
import {DragDropProvider} from '@kousum/dnd-kit-vue';
import {PointerSensor, KeyboardSensor} from '@dnd-kit/dom/sensors';

function App() {
  return (
    <DragDropProvider sensors={[PointerSensor, KeyboardSensor]}>
      {...}
    </DragDropProvider>
  )
}
```

### Local sensors

<Info>Local sensors take precedence over global sensors.</Info>

Sensors can also be applied to individual draggable elements by passing them to the `modifiers` prop.

```jsx
import {useDraggable} from '@kousum/dnd-kit-vue';
import {KeyboardSensor} from '@dnd-kit/dom/sensors';

function Draggable({id}) {
  const {ref} = useDraggable({
    id,
    sensors: [KeyboardSensor],
  });
}
```
